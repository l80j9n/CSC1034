CSC1034:   Lecture   1
Module   Organisation
•   There   are   three   assessments,   each   based   around   a   practical
•      Lectures
•      Practicals
•      Online   Material
•      Lectures:   Will   be   available   on   recap
Material
All   the   material   is   available   in   Canvas.
The   python   sources   used   in   these   notes   are   all   available,   also   linked   from   canvas.
•   If the   script   has   the   line   ##    Status:    Crash,   then   I   am   expecting   it   to   crash
•   A   few   have   the   line   ##    Status:    Shell,   then   it   is   designed   to   be   typed   into   a   python   shell
•   If it   has   neither,   then   it   is   a   runnable   python   script.	
Expectations
•   The   in   person   lectures   provide   the   broad   outline   for   your   work
•   The   online   material   covers   the   whole   syllabus
•   You   should   expect   to   spent   3hrs   a   week   on   the   online   material
•   You   should   spent   four   hours   a   week   on   practicals   and   the   assessment
Lectures/Online
•   There   are   three   weeks   of   material   on   canvas
•    In   the   last   week,   we   will   recap,   do   some   exercises
•   And   give   you   time   to   finish   the   coursework
Practicals
•   There   are   four   hours   of practicals   a   week
•   The   practicals   are   supported   by   a   number   of demonstrators
•   They   are   the   best   opportunity   to   get   one   to   one   support
Other   forms   of   Support
•   I   will   be   available   during   most   practicals
•    Open   for   questions   at   the   end   of   in   person   lectures
•   You   can   email
•    But   I   am   one   person,   so   may   be   slow   in   replying
•   Teams   site   (instructions   on   canvas)
Questions
•   Any   Questions
What   we   teach
•   This   is   an   introductory   module
•      Has   a   very   wide   mix   of backgrounds
•   We   will   touch   on   all   aspects   of programming
–   but   will   not   go   deep   on   any   parts
•   The   written   material   describes   what   you   should   know
•      But   for   many   it will   not   be   enough
How   to   learn
•      Programming   requires   theoretical   understanding
•      But   it   is   also   a   skill
•   You   must   practice
•   And   you   must   use   other   sources   of information   besides   the   material   here
Tutorials
•      Programming   books   come   in   different   styles
•    Many   designed   for   existing   programmers,   learning   a   new   language
•   https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/
•    Can   be   good,   but   hard   to   read
•    Often   explain   what   you   can   do,   but   not   why
Tutorials
•    Some   are   designed   to   do   specific   things
•   https://automatetheboringstuff.com/
•    Can   be   rewarding   because   you   can   “scratch   your   own   itch”
•   https://inventwithpython.com/pygame/
•    Or   leave   you   with   a   good   knowledge   of   one   area   but   not   another
Tutorials
•    Some   are   designed   to   teaching   programming
•   http://openbookproject.net/thinkcs/python/english3e/
•    Gives   an   overview   of   everything
•      But   can   leave   you   struggling   to   apply   things   to   your   own   problems
Tutorials
•   Are   lots   of varieties   of learning   styles
•      Book   like   websites   (start   at   the   beginning)
•   Interactive workthroughs
•   Videos
•      Daily   Puzzles
How   to   Learn
•   You   must   engage   with   the   language   and   with   programming
•    Look   at   several   different   resources   at   once
•   Work through   materials
–      Don’t   stop   if you   don’t   understand   something
–      Do   stop   if you   don’t   understand   anything
How   to   Learn
•      Programming   is   like   learning   a   human   language
•      Be   a   parrot
•      Fiddle with   things
•   Type   (NOT   cut-and-paste)   code   in
•   Try   changing   it   a   bit
How   to   Learn
•   We   will   also   teach   professional   tooling
•   These   will   be   new   to   many
•   Adds   complexity   and   can   be   confusing
•      But   these   tools   are   also   there   to   help
•      Learning   these   will   help   you   to   learn
–    Hopefully like a pole, not buckets on your feet
How   to   Learn
•    For   a   developer,   learning   new   langauges   is   a   lifetime   occupation
•    Much,   much   easier   than   human   languages
•   You   will   see   the   same   ideas   again   and   again
•   Although   every   language   has   a   head   scratcher
•   I   can   usually   become   productive   in   a   week
•   To   get   good   at   a   language   takes   quite   a   bit   longer
Programming   vs   Development
•      Have   split the   material   into:
–      Programming
–    Software   Development
•   This   is   somewhat   artifical   but   useful
Programming
•   Two   key   points   to   learning   to   program
–   You   need   to   learn   what   you   want   to   say
–   And   how   to   say   it
•   With   normal   language,   first   is   easy   and   second   is   hard
•   With   computers,   it   is   the   other   way   around
Programming
•      Programming   is   rich   in   best   practices
–      Do   it this   way   and   it   will   work   better
•      Programming   is   rich   in   conventions
–    Do   it   this   way   because   everyone   else   does   it   this   way
•    Can   be   hard   to   distinguish   the   two
Questions
Polling!    (by   shouting)
Language   (Python)
•   Interpreted   language,   with   (largely   useless)   shell
•    Somewhat   OO,   more   multi   paradigm   these   days
•    Started   off   as   a   system   admin   language
•    Slowly   took   over   in   science   because   everyone   hated   Perl
•   With   the   advent   of NumPy   and   pandas   hit   the   data   science   wave
Why   Python
•    Commonly   used,   very   popular
•      Many   of you   will   have   seen   it   before
•      Different   semantically   from   Java
Why   Not   Python
•      Many   of you   will   have   seen   it   before
•      Syntactically   rather   similar to   Java
•   Whitespace
Programming   Languages
•   Are   primarily written   for   humans to   understand
•    Computers   come   second
•    Most   languages   use   (one   or   more)   idioms   to   support   this
Demo:      Hello   World   and   Calculating
•      Hello World   in   Python
•   And   in   PyCharm
•   And   calculating
Exercises
•   There   are   lots   of   exercises
•   “Look   up   the   formula   for   celsius   to   farenheit   conversion   and   work   out   temperature   that   water   freezes   and   boils   at   in   F.”
•    Formula   F      =    C    *      9/5      +      32,   C      =    F      -      32      *      5      /      9
Python
•   Will   now   through   the   key   points   that   you   should   be   learning   this   week
Python:      Types
•   Values   have   types
•    So   far,   we   have   created   two   numeric   types
–   Integer,   Float
•   Also,   can   deal   with   complex   number
•      Python   will   coerce   between   numeric   types
>>>      ##      Status:      Shell
>>>      ##      Simple      Addition      of    integers   >>>      2      +      2
4
>>>      ##      Addition      of      floats
>>>      2   .0      +      2   .0
4.0
>>>      ##      Addition    of   mixed      types   >>>      2      +      2   .5
4.5
>>>      ##    "True"    Division
>>>      5      /      2
2.5
>>>      ##    "Int"      Division
>>>    5    //    2
2
>>>      ##      Pointless    "Int"      Division      of      floats
>>>    5    //    2   .0
2.0
>>>    ##      And      complex   >>>    3j      +      4j
7j
>>>    ##      And      combined
>>>      1      +      3j   (1+3j)
Python   and   Logic
•   Values   can   also   represent   Boolean   values
•   True or   False   in   python
•      Note   the   upper   case!
•   Also,   with   a   range   of logical   operators
>>>      ##      Status:      Shell
>>>    True
True
>>>    False
False
>>>    True      and      True
True
>>>    True      and      False


False
>>>      True      or      False
True
>>>      True      and      not      False
True
Python   and   strings
•      Python   will   coerce   between   numeric   types
•      But   not   strings   and   numerics
##   Status:    Crash
2    +      "2"
Traceback    (most      recent    call      last):

TypeError:      unsupported      operand      type(s)      for      +:    ' int   '       and    '   str   '
Variables
•   We   can   assign   a   value   to   a   variable
•   In   python   a   variable   is   defined   using   a   name
•   Aside:   most   examples   are   now   not   using   the   shell
•   If we   wish   to   see   things   in   the   output,   we   need   to   print   them
Variables
x      =      2
y      =      2
print   (x      +      y)   4
Variables
x      =      200
•   x –   the   identifier
•    = –   the   assignment
•    200   –   the   value


Variables:      identifiers
•    Getting   the   naming   wrong   is   a   common   mistake
•      Python   normally   signals   with   a   NameError
•    Coming   up   with   good   names   is   hard
•      Follow   Python   coding   conventions
•    Do   not   favour   short   names   just   because   they   are   less   typing
Lists
•   What   if we   want   to   store   many   values?
students_in_room      =    100
student1      =      "John"               student2      =    "Paul"               student3      =      "George"   student4      =    "Ringo"
•      But   what   if we   do   not   know   how   many   values?   ##   Lists
•   Think   of it   like   a   set   of pigeon   holes
•    Lists   are   values,   so   can   be   held   by   variables
•   We   can   access   individual   values   by   index
•    Lists   start   from   0
##   Status:      Shell
students_in_room      =    100
student_names      =      [   "John"   ,    "Paul"   ,    "George"   ,      "Ringo"]
student_names[0]   student_names[3]
>>>      ##      Status:      Shell
>>>    students_in_room      =      100
>>>    student_names   代 写CSC1034: Lecture 1Java
代做程序编程语言   =      ["John",    "Paul",    "George",    "Ringo"]
>>>    student_names[0]
'   John   '
>>>    student_names[3]


' Ringo   '
Dictionaries
•    Sometimes,   however,   numbers   are   just   not   convenient
•    Say,   we   need   to   store   some   attributes   of   a   train
•   We   could   do   this:
##      0      -      Name
##    1      -      Colour
##   2      -    Engine      Type ##      3    -      Train      Type       ##   4      -      Role
wilson      =    [   "wilson"   ,    "red"   ,    "diesel"   ,      "EMD    F3"   ,    "Trainee"]
print   (wilson)
[   ' wilson   '   ,      ' red   '   ,      ' diesel   '   ,      ' EMD      F3   '   ,      '   Trainee   ']
•      But   this   is   painful.   Hard   to   remember,   easy   to   get   wrong
Dictionaries
•   It   is   much   better   to   use   a   dictionary
•   Very   similar to   a   list   but   with   names
•   The   map   between   keys   and   values
wilson      =      {
"name"   :    "wilson"   ,
"colour"   :      "red"   ,
"engine"   :    "diesel"   ,   "type"   :      "EMD      F3"   ,
"role"   :      "Trainee"
}
print   (wilson)
{   '   name   '   :      ' wilson   '   ,      ' colour   '   :      ' red   '   ,      ' engine   '   :      ' diesel   '   ,      ' type   '   :      ' EMD      F3   '   ,      ' role   '   :      '   Trainee   '}
Operations
•      Now   that   we   have   our   collections,   what   can   we   do   with   them?
•      Mostly,   we   want   to   do   something   to   everything
•      Python   has   a   number   of ways   of achieving   this
•   The   list   comprehension   is   probably   the   most   succinct


##   Status:      Shell
y      =      [1   ,2   ,3   ,4   ,5]
##      square    every      element      in      y
[x**2      for      x      in      y]
##      or      in    the      given      list
[x**2      for      x      in      [1   ,2   ,3   ,4   ,5]]
##      we    can    use    any    variable      for    the    iterator    variable
[n**2      for      n      in      y]
##      even      this!
[y**2      for      y      in      y]
>>>      ##      Status:      Shell
>>>      y      =      [1,2,3,4,5]
>>>    ##    square      every      element      in      y   >>>      [x**2      for      x      in      y]
[1,      4,      9,      16,      25]
>>>      ##      or      in      the      given      list
>>>    [x**2    for      x      in    [1,2,3,4,5]]   [1,      4,      9,      16,      25]
>>>      ##      we      can      use      any      variable      for      the      iterator      variable

Operations
•    Combined   with   the   range   function   can   be   very   powerful
##   Status:      Shell
[x**2      for      x      in      range   (100)]   >>>      ##      Status:      Shell
>>>      [x**2      for      x      in      range(100)]
[0,    1,      4,    9,    16,    25,    36,      49,      64,      81,    100,    121,    144,    169,    196,    225,    256,    289,    324,    361,    400,
Conditions
•    Python   also   uses   blocks   for   conditions
•    Sometimes,   want   to   do   different   things   at   different   times
•   We   have   a   condition   “if this then   do   that”
x=2
if   (      x      >    10      ):               print   (True)
else   :
print   (False)
x=20
if   (      x      >    10      ):               print   (True)
else   :
print   (False)
False   True
Functions
•      Functions   are   a   critical   part   of programming
•      Most   programs   consist   of a   large   number   of functions
•   When   it   was   created,   Python   was   largely   procedural
•    Over   the   years,   it   has   gained   many   more   functional   features
•   We   have   already   seen   many   functions:    print,   list   and   sorted   are   all   example


Functions
•   A   function   takes   a   number   of parameters   and   returns   a   value
def      add(x,y):
return      x+y               print   (add(2   ,      3))   5
Functions
def      add(x,y):
return      x      +      y
•      def –   function   definition   coming   up
•    add –   an   identifier   or   name   for   the   function
•      () –   here   come   the   parameters
•   x,y – the   parameters   of   the   function
•      :   –   here   comes   a   block
•      return – return   the   result   of this   statement
•   x+y   add   x   and   y
Programming   Conclusion
•   I   have   taken   you   rapidly   through   all   the   key   elements   of Python
•   I   have   touched   very   briefly   on   each   item
•   There   is   more   material   on   canvas
•   And   a   variety   of exercises
•   Try   them!
Development
•   Writing   good   software   is   many   things
•   It’s   not just   programming
•      Here   is   my   list with   arbitrary   definitions
–      Programming:    Writing   clean,   efficient,   well-documented   code   that   makes   sensible   use   of the   language   of choice
–   Algorithms:   Understand   (enough) of   the   mathematics   of   computation
–    User   Design:   Making   sure   your   software   does   something   people   actu-   ally   want
–   Testing:   Making   sure   that   the   software   does   what   you   think   it   does
–   Architecture:   Defining   the   interfaces   of software   modules   so   they   fit   together
Software   Development

•      Partly   about tools,   Partly   about   practices
•    Some   of these   you   will   have   seen   before
•    Some   will   be   unfamiliar
•    Some   are   hard   to   motivate   and   understand
–    Mostly,   until   you   have   hit   the   problem   they   solve
Versioning
•   Versioning   tools   are,   I   think,   the   single   most   important   tool
•      But why   do   we   want   it?
Motivation
•   “Well,   it was   working   last   night”
•    Change   code   to   add   feature
•      Find   it   breaks   something
•    Change   code   back,   to   find   it’s   still   broken
Motivation
•   “Which idiot   did   that????”
•   A   weird   bug   shows   up
•   You   need   to   find   who   caused   it
•   Alas,   it   often turns   out   to   be   you
Motivation
•   “What did   the   idiot   do?”
•   A   weird   bug   shows   up
•   You   need   to   know   exactly   what   the   change   was
•   Again,   you   may   well   be   the   idiot
•      Programming   involves   a   lot   of short-term   memory
•   You   forget   very   quickly   what   you   did!
Motivation
•   “I   am   using   the   software   you   released   last   year   and   it’s   not   working”
•      Updating   software   can   be   slow   and   painful
•      Particularly   if many   other things   depend   on   it
•    So,   there   may   be   several   versions   of the   software   around
Motivation
•   “We   should work   together   on   this”
•   Working   on   code   together   can   be   difficult
•    One   person   can   overwrite   changes   made   by   the   other
•   The   time   spent   coordinating   can   outweigh   the   benefit
•   “The Mythical   Man   Month”
Motivation
•   “We   should   work   together,   but   I   am   in   a   different   time   zone”
•   The   situation   is   worse   if you   can   only   email   people
•   And   worse,   worse   if you   are   never   awake   at   the   same   time
Version   Control
•   The   solution   to   all   these   turns   out   to   be   version   control
•   “How   do   I   control   all   the   versions   I   have   of a   file
Versioning
•   We   are   using   git   in   the   school
•   It   has   become   a   very   widely   used   standard
•   It   British   slang   also   means   an   irritating,   contemptable   or   nasty   person
•    Git   can   be   a   bit   quirky,   so   the   name   is   not   inappropriate
Versioning
•   In   the   broadest   sense,   it   is   very   simple
–   Write   or   change   a   bit   of   code
–   Write   a   comment   saying   what   you   did
–   “Save”   a   version

Writing the   alphabet
Generation   0
•      Pre-1982
•    Change   a   few   files
•    Copy   all   the   files
Generation   1:      RCS
•      RCS –   Revision   Control   System,   by   Walter   Tichy
•   Introduced   “Reverse   Delta”   and   “Locking”
Generation   1:      Reverse   Delta
•   Imagine   we   have   this   file:                                          a()   b()   c()
d()
Generation   1:      Reverse   Delta
•   And   we   change   it   to   this   file:                               a()   b()   c()   d()
e()
Generation   1:      Reverse   Delta
•   We   can   say   this   instead:
diff   1.txt   2.txt   ***   2,4   ****            —   2,5   —-
b()
c()
d()
+   e()
Generation   1:      Reverse   Delta
•    Or   in   RCS   format   which   is   terser:
diff   -n   1.txt   2.txt
a4   1   e()
Generation   1:      Reverse   Delta
•      But   to   work   out   the   current   version,   I   need   to   apply   many   deltas
•    Store   the   latest   version
•   And   delta’s   backward
Generation   2:      CVS
•    CVS   took   a   different   approach   than   RCS
•   Allow   concurrent   editing.
•    CVS   ==   Concurrent   Version   System
•   Also,   the   name   of   a   US   chemist
Generation   2:      Modify-Merge
•      Let   people   do   what   they   want
•   Then   fix   it   at the   end
•    Clever   merging   –   not   single   file   based
•    Sounds   terrible,   but   in   practice   works   well
•   Tools   like   Dropbox,   work   like   this
•      Except   without   the   clever   merging
Generation   2:      SVN
•    CVS   became   THE   versioning   system   for   a   long   time
•    First   release   1990
•    Eventually   largely   replaced   by   Subversion   (SVN)
•    SVN   is   the   same   as   CVS   (but   better)
Generation   3:      DVCS
•      DVCS   work   like   a   combination   of RCS   and   SVN
•    Each   developer   works   on   their   own   workspace
•   Then   there   are   systems   for   sending   changes   between   these   workspaces
•   Allows   many   different   works   flows
